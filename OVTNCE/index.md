								<li>2:19 PM: Great! I'm Michael B, one of the event hosts for our ‚ÄòUS.92654(Laguna Hills) SimulSquad‚Ñ¢(SS)üíÉüíÉ üíªBYODüíª (coworking+)‚Äô, where impressively we've held ~154 sessions since 2014; for example our yesterday group <a href="https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipPly4KqUzD-HRajsACOq3cziOqTGQvSnAhrWSt5">pic 20170904_205419</a> also including regular co-host Lucy.&nbsp; </li>
								<li>2:20 PM: At our restaurant patio meeting yesterday, precocious frank cosplayer Adiba took our pic <a href="https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipMaRluToidUY38cRluUJ9mZSsgoJymuanIO0e3T">20170904_185220</a> and became notably interested in joining us, especially as she spotted on our flyer we do&nbsp; video game design, among many other healthy fun info activities; and indeed we likely can well help her design her 1st video game,. plus (likely foremost) help her legitimately ace her school work, and more, as we regularly help out students even teens, per us being open to &amp; having all ages (well above say age 10). </li>
								<li>2:20 PM: But as she is so young, I told her we need to first get approval of her parent, including first meet at least one, ideally by having her parent(s) visit one of our events, which are 100% at quality restaurants (and for our any events elsewhere, we'd also require special parental approval for anyone so young). Well we now operate 10am to midnite Mon+Tue+Thu(+Sun if demand), so actually we're doing one again today then again Thu,Mon,etc. When might u like to visit?? -so u can find out about us and we about u &amp; Adiba. </li>

Though before he left outside with his cap off, I noticed quite a few scars on his head, so asked him about that. He explained that he had been in an accident, I correctly guessed motorcycle, where did a head-on collision with&nbsp; a car, throwing him in the air &amp; causing his helmet to fly off and having his skull crack in ~23 places. He was very lucky to be alive, afterwards couldn't&nbsp; even talk, and it now still messes up his speech.</li>
